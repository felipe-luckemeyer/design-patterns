// Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software

// Read chapters 1 and 2 (explain about design patters):

// What is a Design Pattern?
// - A problem which occurs a lot of times in our environment and the possibility to create a solution that can be used several times over.

// Patterns can be separated in three different purposes:
// - Creational: concern the process of object creation;
// - Strutural: deal with the composition of classes or objects;
// - Behavioral: characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility.

// There are many ways the patterns can be organized. We can also do a mind map
// that connect all the patterns, showing the relationship of each other.

// After that, learn the following patterns:
// - Abstract Factory (page 87)
// - Factory Method (page 107)
// - Adapter (page 139)
// - Composite (page 163) => MVC
// - Decorator (page 175)
// - Observer (page 293) => MVC
// - Strategy (page 315) => MVC
// - Template Method (page 325)
