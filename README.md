# Design Patterns
A dedicated repository to learn more about design patterns and understand how they works. The reference for this content is a book called "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software".

## What is a Design Pattern?
A problem which occurs a lot of times in our environment and the possibility to create a solution that can be used several times over.

## Patterns separation:
There are many ways the patterns can be separated. We can do a mind map that connect all of them showing the relationship of each other like this:

You can also separate patterns in three different purposes:
- Creational: concern the process of object creation;
- Strutural: deal with the composition of classes or objects;
- Behavioral: the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility.
